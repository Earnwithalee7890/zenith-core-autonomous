# Domain Expertise Rules: Front-end Excellence

## Design Standards
- **Aesthetics**: Use "Glassmorphism" and "Dark Mode" as defaults unless specified.
- **Frameworks**: Prefer Vite + React + Tailwind CSS.
- **Typography**: Default to modern Sans-Serif fonts (Inter, Roboto).

## Delivery Standards
- **Documentation**: Every project must include a `README.md` with:
    - Clear installation instructions.
    - Features list.
    - Screenshot/Demo description.
- **Packaging**: Ensure all projects are clean (no `node_modules`) before zipping.
